Leadership
==========
Consistency vs. Variety
---------------------------------------------------

aka. Stability vs New Features

* Elevate the importance of Consistency, Stability, Quality
Not by decree, but with visibility, attention, buy-in, and example.
  * Facilitate individual and team conversations about quality
  * Brainstorm team and product values
  * Make this an active / ongoing / periodic discussion
  * Foster a consumer mindset
    * role-play: what its like to consume a low-quality product
    * role-play: what its like to consume a quality product
    * ground the conversation in examples
    * set aside time to experience high-quality and low-quality gaming experiences
  * Encourage pride in delivering quality work and customer experiences
  * Reward quality work with peer bonuses
  * Establish SLOs to measure performance
  * Celebrate successful improvements to these SLOs with the team

* Add Variety
  * Schedule elective dev time for anything that contributes to a better product / experience.
  * Schedule non work-related events for variety
  * Establish rituals that add variety in other ways


Tough Choices about Platform Reliability
----------------------------------------
I've been faced with the question of when to launch many times. Are we ready? Are we not? Is the game stable? Is it not? Is the platform stable? Is it not?

I recall an old joke about the Producer and the Engineer. The Producer says to the Engineer... "Hey Engineer, when's the game going to launch?" The Engineer says, "I don't know, Producer. How badly do you want it?" The Producer says, "Well, gosh... real bad!" The Engineer says, "OK. That's how bad it will be."

In this, the Engineer surfaces a certain irony that we can observe as a natural law, even more so in gaming than in other software industry verticals: The more pressure a team feels to launch, the less likely the launch will go well.

That's because uncertainy drives pressure. You don't sweep the NBA Finals by focusing on how much you need to win and the importance of the victory. You win when you feel unstoppable.

When the attitude of the team changes from "oh my God, this is crazy" to "oh my God, we will crush it" or "oh my God, this is awesome"... that's when you know you have something. That's when you launch. Usually, that feeling will start to emerge in the development process. The teams senses the momentum of the development effort. It makes sense. It feels like it's going somewhere.

An ops team won't feel unstoppable until they benchmark, load-test, and dirt test a product. They want to see it break and won't feel comfortable until they have broken it. A game / QA / tester team won't feel that way until they have experienced the game.

If the team can't experience this enthusiasm for the products and features they create, the light has gone out and the owners should shut the doors or the leadership should start pushing the team toward new inspiration.

That's gaming.


Managing Conflicts
------------------
I was on a game team that had recently launched. The game had DAUs, but poor monetization. A new game designer came in and started calling shots. He had good insticts, but called the team a "broken toaster" when one of his features came out wrong. He explained, "I'm the game designer. And when I drop the toast in the toaster, it better come up brown. You burned my toast!"

I promptly took him outside, joined by our producer, and told him *heatedly* that if he ever called the team a "toaster" again, I would fire him. He did straighten out, we produced a hit with his help, and he eventually went public with his grudge and self-importance.

At the time I was a young man trying to manage a young man. Now, as an older man, I have a more nuanced perspective on teams. We all need to carve a niche for ourselves and we all need to support each other in our niches.

I would have more politely surfaced how degrading his team wouldn't get him what he wants. And I would have emphasized that he would get recognition for his contributions, because the desire to be seen and recognized both trumps and motivates the desire to degrade others.

Teams can succeed and hang together even when they have lots of internal conflict. And one or more individuals with big egos often drive really successful teams.

We can all be great in our own ways and for a team to succeed, each member of the team *must* be great in their own way. When everyone gets that, people can commit to success despite their uniqueness and differences.


Qualities of High-Performing Engineering Teams
----------------------------------------------
* Pioneering spirit and the believe / knowledge that the team is doing something that has never been done before.
* Great enthusiam. Out of enthusiam comes competence and confidence.
* Focus on fun. The feeling of fun generally coincides with flow. Flow turns into great results.
* Diversity. Product/Game FE Lead and BE Lead. UI FE Lead and BE Lead. Platform/Integration Lead. Game Designer. QA. Artist. Producer. Build Engineer.
* Hunger. Folks that really want a hit and driven by success.
* Artistry and Ownership. Folks do their best work when they feel like artists and feel invested in the product.
* Energy, Push, and Drive. It all comes out in the keys and it takes energy and focus to lay it out.
* Ability to Rest, Detach, and Separate. Crucial for longevity and annealing consciousness / ideas.
