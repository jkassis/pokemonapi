# 10kv Bear

## Background Lore

Born on the rim of a canyon reaching miles into the core of the Earth, the 10kv Bear came into the light.

He stood one day on the dam of the river that carved the canyon, looking down into the water below when lightening struck him from above. The dam exploded and all the power of the river entered his body electrifying him forever.

Now with the power of his mind, he focuses the force within him into powerful plasma streams and magnetic fields. Through his will alone, electrical fire emanates in any direction and he floats on clouds of ozone and ionic wind.

He uses the energy of his body to heal his friends and defeat his foes, but alas remains forever distant with his skin charged to 10kv and painful to the touch.

Still, he finds great joy occaisionly walking among the people, entertaining them with the sparks that often jump out of his #!$%.
